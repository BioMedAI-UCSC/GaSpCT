# GaSpCT: Gaussian splatting for novel brain CBCT projection view synthesis

## Overview
GaSpCT is an adaptation of Gaussian Splatting specifically designed for CT projection images. This project extends the original work by INRIA to handle medical imaging applications.

## Original Work
This repository is heavily based on the Gaussian Splatting repository by INRIA:
- [Original Repository](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting)
- [Research Paper](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/3d_gaussian_splatting_high.pdf)

## Project Status
This project has been accepted for a poster presentation in SPIE Medical Imaging 2025, in San Diego
